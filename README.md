 This app is made with help of Polygon. It helps the app for a gas free and fast transactions.It also helps for easy Ethereum trancsaction with help of solidity.The best part of polygon is you can use it without changing anything in your solidity code . 

# Complete overview of the app

The app is made with flutter and dart programing language.The entire layout of the design was made in Figma.Using the layout in Figma ,the UI/UX was created.Flutter is the face of the app , which is the frontend of the app.The Payment section is done with solidity and was tested in a local blockchain with the help of Ganache.Then it was deloyed in Goërli mumbia testnet. This is how we have a successful wallet for transaction in our app.

# What features to be added

+ Proper functioning sign up page
+ Cart , for better experience and maganing products during purchase in our app
+ A portal for the seller to sell their products
+ Reviews based on the buyers response

# End goals

With this blockchain based e-comerce app we are looking to integrate every working feature of this app on an existing blockchain (in the future updates), with the help of smart contracts. This not only reduces the overall operating cost but is also environmental friendly as it does not require large data centers to operate and thus has very less carbon footprint. Given that crypto transactions are very safe and come at a lower cost we are looking to reduce the overall price of product by a margin of 10% as compared to conventional shopping apps , all thanks to cheaper transaction rates of blockchain like ethereum.
